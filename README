Instead of finding the best possible path through all the nodes via exploration, 
I used A* with an approach heuristic to attempt to find the most optimal path at a minimal cost

You can also use exploration to find all of the costs between each node via constant neighbour search
And run dijkstra's algorithm to get the optimal path
